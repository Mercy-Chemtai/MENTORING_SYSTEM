                <b> <h1></h1> Summary Of Born A Crime</h1> </b> 
            The book summarizes a young child from South Africa during the days of colonialism.<br>
             How the policy of apartheid segregated people of South Africa Initially there were conflicts<br>
              among groups of people like the Zulu and Xshoa.<br>
           <br>
            Chapter1 and Chapter2 summary
            <br>
            <br>
            This chapter narrates the story of Trevor Noah, a young  South African man explaining her life<br>
             story of growing up before and after the apartheid policy. Trevor grew up in a family that <br>
             was devoted to Christianity in this case I mean every Sunday they had to attend three <br>
             services, one service in every church. There were three churches one for blacks, another<br>
              for mixed races, and whites. From the book,  Africans distinctively interpret Christianity, <br>
              including how Trevor’s mother considers blessings and prayers rewarding. Through this <br>
              Trevor’s mother didn’t want jokes about going to church hence anytime Trevor would talk<br>
               negatively about church the mother would discipline him on the spot. <br>
              <br>
            
        
            During the apartheid period, Trevor grew up with a white father and a Black mother when<br>
             sexual relationships were against the law which was enforced by the whites. Trevor's mother <br>
             worked hard to make ends meet by even running to go and live near her workplace where they <br>
             became friends with a Swiss man who she wanted to give her a child. Trevor’s existence was <br>
             against the law, so Trevor’s mother had to evade questions about her son’s light skin.<br>
